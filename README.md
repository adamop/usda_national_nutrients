=======================

MySQL Export of USDA National Nutrients Data

Taken from ZIP archive available here:
http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR25/dnload/sr25.zip

A nice (OK, I'm just guessing) person formatted the data in JSON
http://ashleyw.co.uk/project/food-nutrient-database

I wanted it in MySQL form, but couldn't find it anywhere.  Hope you find it useful.

The schemas follow the descriptions laid out in the provided PDF.  If you find any problems with the schema, or the integrity of the data please let me know.
